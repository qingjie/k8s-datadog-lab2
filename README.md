# Progressive Delivery in Kubernetes
## Course Overview

  ### Introduction
  
  * Will a new version of my service drive more usage? Will it reduce or increase the overall latency of my application? Can I easily test it in production for a set of users first? Progressive delivery, A/B testing, and canary deployments are strategies that help answer those questions by splitting network traffic in a controlled manner, allowing you to make informed decisions on the quality of a release.

  * In this course we will demonstrate several strategies to implement progressive delivery in Kubernetes. You will learn which of those strategies is best suited to your organization needs and how a good observability strategy is key to be successful with progressive delivery.

  * Additional Requirements: Attendees who already know how to schedule a containerized application to Kubernetes will make the most of this course.
